[--> See it live.](https://superjoshua.github.io/fcc-rom-num-converter/)

Roman numbers: MCDLXVI. It's amazing how long we'll put up with really cumbersome ways of doing things. But this isn't a diatribe on human perverseness. It's a way to turn numbers into letters.

This was a project required for getting the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certificate from freeCodeCamp. It had to pass these tests.

- You should have an input element with an id of "number".
- You should have a button element with an id of "convert-btn".
- You should have a div, span, or p element with an id of "output".
- When you click on the #convert-btn element without entering a value into the #number element, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a valid number".
- When the #number element contains the number -1 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1".
- When the #number element contains the number 4000 or greater and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999".
- When the #number element contains the number 9 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "IX".
- When the #number element contains the number 16 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "XVI".
- When the #number element contains the number 649 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "DCXLIX".
- When the #number element contains the number 1023 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "MXXIII".
- When the #number element contains the number 3999 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "MMMCMXCIX".
- When the #number element contains a random negative number and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1".
- When the #number element contains a number greater than 4000 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999".
